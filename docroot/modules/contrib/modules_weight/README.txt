INTRODUCTION
------------

Sometimes we need to modify modules execution order, and some people could write
a code that execute the query to modify the weight of a module in the system 
table, some one might go straight to his favorite SQL client and modify the 
record directly. This module provides an interface to reorder the modules
weight.
