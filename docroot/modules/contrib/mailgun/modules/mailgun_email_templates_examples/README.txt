* Introduction

This module provides several examples of nice HTML email templates.
They can be used in your projects or just examined for some inspiration.

Originally, they were published at Mailgun official blog:
https://www.mailgun.com/blog/transactional-html-email-templates
Kudos to Mailgun team, by the way!

* Configuration

To enable these or any other email templates, enable "Use Theme" checkbox:
Mailgun Settings > Advanced settings.

Following the same approach, you can override email templates in your custom
theme.
