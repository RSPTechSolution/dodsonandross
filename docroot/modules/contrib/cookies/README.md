COOKiES
-------

User consent management module for Drupal 8 and 9.

The module enables existing third-party-integration modules continued to be
used in compliance with the GDPR (of course without manipulating their code).
It solves the basic problem that when using third-party-integration modules,
the user must agree to the use of cookies (according to GDPR) before they are
installed.

IMPORTANT: No liability is assumed regarding compliance with the GDPR.

The COOKiES module provides (with the Library [Cookies JSR][cookiesjsr]) a
  fully configurable user interface for user decisions. It also supports out-
  of-the-box some key third-party integration modules (especially those
  included in the Thunder distribution):

 * [Google Analytics module][analytics]
 * [Google Tag Manager][gtag]
 * [Video embed, core:media][mvideoembed]
 * [Twitter media module][mtwitter]
 * [Instagram media module][minstagram]

Develop
-------

For developers, with these Modules there are some easy-to-understand sample
  modules available for integrating further third-party integration modules
  into user consent management. It contains code that controls the interfaces
  and best practices to implement practically any requirement quickly and
  easily.
