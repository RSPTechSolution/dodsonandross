COOKiES Filter
-----------------

## Introduction

The COOKiES Filter module supplies a "COOKiES Filter" text format filter and
"COOKiES filter service" entities, which provide ways to block
"script", "embed", "iframe", "img" and "object" html elements, using a
"COOKiES service" of your choice.

There are three blocking modes:

- None (Keep as is): Only disables the blocked element.
- Hide: Disables and Hides the blcoked element.
- Overlay: Disables and presents a cookies overlay over the blocked element.

The module also supports blocking html elements, based on given css selectors.

Additionally you can specify custom css selectors to select an html element,
which should have the overlay applied to, instead of the blocked elements.

## Install

After you have installed the COOKiES Filter module, go to
"/admin/structure/cookies_service_filter" to create a "COOKiES service filter"
entity. Optionally you can create a "COOKiES service" first, which you want to
use the filter for. After creating the "COOKiES service filter" entity, go to
"/admin/config/content/formats" and apply the
"COOKiES Filter: 2-Click Consent for page elements" text format filter to your
desired text format.
Now all the html elements, specified in your "COOKiES service filter" entities,
will get blocked in the defined text format.
