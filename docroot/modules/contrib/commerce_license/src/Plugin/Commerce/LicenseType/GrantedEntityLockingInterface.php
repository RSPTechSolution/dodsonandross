 * Interface for license types that lock an aspect of the entities they grant.

 * removal of something the licenes grants, and thus prevent the license and the
 * entity getting out of sync.
 *
 * For example, the Role license type that grants a role to a user prevents the
 * user having that role removed in the user edit form.
